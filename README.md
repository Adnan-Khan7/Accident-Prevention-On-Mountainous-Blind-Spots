# Accident-Prevention-On-Mountainous-Blind-Spots
In the developing nations, road accidents are the significant reasons for death. For instance, if we look at the main 10 risky roads in the world, we can see that every one of them is a mountainous road. In the mountain roads, there will be tight bends and the roads will be restricted. In these sorts of circumstances, the driver of a vehicle cannot see vehicles approaching from the inverse side. A great many individuals lose their lives every year due to this issue. Since we are discuss-ing mountain roads, here the opposite side may lead to a precipice. The answer to this issue is cautioning the driver about the vehicle originating from the inverse side. This objective is achieved by building a module that will detect vehicle position and speed and aware of the driv-er in the vehicle of the incoming cars. These goals are achieved using fast and reliable V2V (Ve-hicle to Vehicle) communication. The modules in each respective car will exchange the data which will help to prevent mishaps, especially in mountainous curves.
